Social media has become the primary news source
in the United States, yet user awareness alone cannot prevent
misinformation spread. This study investigates network-based
interventions to limit misinformation propagation on Reddit
using the FACTOID dataset of users and their interactions.
We evaluate seed selection strategies using centrality metrics
and implement a competitive cascade model where factual
information competes against misinformation. Our key finding
addresses the superspreader dilemma: while removing high-
influence accounts is topologically optimal, it incurs substantial
social costs. We compare two intervention strategies under a
super-linear cost model: removing few influential users versus
removing many smaller users. Results show that (1) out-degree
centrality outperforms other metrics for seed selection, (2)
misinformation spreads more efficiently than factual content,
and (3) removing many smaller users achieves greater impact
than removing few superspreaders under the same budget
constraint. These findings suggest that targeting numerous low-
influence accounts provides a more cost-effective approach to
neutralizing misinformation spread than banning high-profile
users.
