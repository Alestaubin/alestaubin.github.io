Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) policies frequently fail
when deployed in environments that differ from their training
conditions. In this work, we propose a self-supervised Test-
Time Adaptation (TTA) framework that leverages an auxiliary
Inverse Dynamics (ID) objective to update the agent’s encoder
during deployment. Unlike prior methods that update all
encoder weights, we introduce an adaptation strategy that
freezes the policy backbone and updates only the normalization
statistics of the shared layers. We evaluate this method on the
CausalWorld robotic benchmark under two distinct shift types:
physical dynamics (robot mass) and spatial distribution (goal
position). Our results show that joint training with the auxiliary
task significantly improves baseline robustness. Furthermore,
we find that Lifelong Adaptation outperforms episodic adapta
tion and zero-shot baselines, recovering policy performance on
severe out-of-distribution (OOD) goal shifts where frozen agents
fail. These findings suggest that constrained, self-supervised
adaptation is a viable path for robustifying robot policies
against unforeseen variations without access to reward signals.
