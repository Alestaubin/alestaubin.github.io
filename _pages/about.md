## About Me
Originally from Montreal, I moved to Vancouver in September 2025 to begin my MSc in Computer Science at the University of British Columbia. Prior to this, I completed a Joint Honours in Mathematics and Computer Science at McGill University.

## Research & Academic Interests

During my undergrad, I explored two distinct fields, 

- Robotics: I focused on imitation learning for long-horizon manipulation tasks, seeking to make robotic interaction more intuitive and capable.

- Social Science: I investigated the societal impacts of AI, specifically analyzing the effects of deepfakes on U.S. elections.

I am particularly interested in how we can build robust, adaptable systems, whether they are robotic or computer vision systems.

## Beyond the Lab
Apart from academia, I’ve been an avid skier my whole life, though I’ll admit I come from the dark side of the sport, ski racing. These days, I’m trading racing for touring! I also enjoy running and trying out new beers.

If it were up to me, I’d be out camping every single weekend. My main side thing is photography, and I make it a point to bring my camera along on every trip to capture the landscape.
